this.recognition.continuous = false;
this.recognition.interimResults = true;
this.recognition.lang = 'en-US';
```

### Context Integration

```javascript
// Real-time context from live coaching system
const context = {
  gameState: window.liveCoaching.gameState,
  playerStats: Array.from(window.liveCoaching.playerStats.entries()),
  aiInsights: window.liveCoaching.aiInsights,
  trackingData: window.aiTracker.analytics,
};
```

### Response Generation

```javascript
// Intent-based response system
const intent = this.analyzeIntent(message);
const response = await this.generateAIResponse(message, intent, context);
```

## Sample Interactions

### Performance Analysis Request

**User (Voice):** "How's my shooting looking tonight?"

**AI Response:**

```
üìä Shooting Analysis:
‚Ä¢ Field goal percentage: 67% (above average)
‚Ä¢ Three-point accuracy: 42% (excellent)
‚Ä¢ Shot selection: Very good
‚Ä¢ Follow-through consistency: 95%

Recommendation: Your mechanics are solid. Focus on maintaining
this rhythm and consider increasing volume from the corners
where you're shooting 85%.
```

### Tactical Advice Request

**User (Text):** "What defensive adjustment should we make?"

**AI Response:**

```
üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Strategy:
Based on current game data, they're running pick-and-roll
38% of possessions with 74% success rate.

Adjustments:
‚Ä¢ Switch on screens above the free-throw line
‚Ä¢ Hard hedge on their primary ball handler
‚Ä¢ Weak-side help rotation improved
‚Ä¢ Force them to their weak side (left)

This should reduce their efficiency by 15-20%.
```

### Motivational Support
