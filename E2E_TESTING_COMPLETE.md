## 🔧 Test Development Framework

### Test Helper Utilities

```javascript
// Login as any user type
await helpers.loginAs('coach');

// Fill forms with validation
await helpers.fillForm({
  '[data-testid="input"]': 'value',
});

// Expect specific outcomes
await helpers.expectToast('success');
await helpers.expectValidationError();

// Generate test data
const testUser = helpers.generateTestData('player');
```

### Security Testing Patterns

```javascript
// Test XSS prevention
await helpers.testXSSPrevention(
  '[data-testid="input"]',
  '[data-testid="display"]'
);

// Performance measurement
const metrics = await helpers.measurePageLoadTime('/');
expect(metrics.clientLoadTime).toBeLessThan(3000);
```

### Mobile Testing Support

```javascript
// Mobile viewport testing
await helpers.setMobileViewport();
await helpers.testTouchInteraction('[data-testid="button"]');
```
