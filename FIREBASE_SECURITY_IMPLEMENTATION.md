**Problem**: User roles stored in `localStorage` can be easily manipulated by users
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Unauthorized access to admin functionality

## âœ… Solution: Firebase Custom Claims

This implementation provides secure, server-side role management that cannot be tampered with by users.

## Implementation Files

### 1. Cloud Functions Setup

- `functions/src/index.js` - Role management functions
- `functions/package.json` - Dependencies

### 2. Updated Client Code

- `secureAuth.js` - Replaces insecure auth.js
- `roleManager.js` - Client-side role verification
- Updated Firestore security rules

### 3. Migration Strategy

- Secure role assignment process
- Backward compatibility considerations
- Testing procedures

## Benefits

âœ… **Server-side verification**: Roles verified by Firebase Auth
âœ… **Tamper-proof**: Cannot be modified by client-side code
âœ… **Integrated security**: Works with Firestore security rules
âœ… **Token-based**: Roles included in secure JWT tokens
âœ… **Scalable**: Supports multiple roles and permissions
