        { x: 0.52, y: 0.48 },
        { x: 0.54, y: 0.46 },
      ], // Predicted path
    },
    actions: [
      {
        type: 'shot',
        playerId: '23',
        shotType: '3PT',
        position: { x: 0.3, y: 0.4 },
        made: true,
        confidence: 0.89,
        effectiveness: 0.92, // Shot quality rating
        gameContext: 'clutch', // Game situation
      },
    ],
  },
  insights: {
    shotAccuracy: '67%',
    pace: 'Fast',
    fatigueLevel: 'Medium',
    momentum: '+Lakers',
    // NEW: Enhanced insights
    formation: 'spread_offense',
    nextPlayPrediction: 'pick_and_roll',
    keyPlayerAlert: { playerId: '15', message: 'Hot streak detected' },
