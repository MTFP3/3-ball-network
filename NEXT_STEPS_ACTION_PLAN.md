## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY

### Security & Configuration

- ‚úÖ **Firebase Configuration Secured** - All API keys moved to environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Vite Configuration Fixed** - Removed duplicate define keys, clean build
- ‚úÖ **Development Server Working** - Running on http://localhost:3000
- ‚úÖ **Missing Files Created** - Added index.js and analyticsLogger.js
- ‚úÖ **teamCharts.js Modernized** - Added secure authentication and role-based access

### Infrastructure

- ‚úÖ **Environment Variable System** - .env files configured for dev/staging/production
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Environment Builds** - npm scripts for different environments
- ‚úÖ **Analytics & Logging** - Comprehensive logging system implemented
- ‚úÖ **Security Documentation** - Complete guides created

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Today/Tomorrow)

### 1. Deploy Firebase Functions (30 minutes)

```bash
cd functions
npm install
firebase deploy --only functions
```

**Result:** Secure role management active in production

### 2. Test Authentication Flow (15 minutes)

- Visit http://localhost:3000/admin.html
- Test user registration and role assignment
- Verify custom claims are working

### 3. Configure Production Environment (20 minutes)

```bash
# Set up production Firebase project
cp .env.template .env.production
# Edit with production credentials
```
