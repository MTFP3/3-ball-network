- [ ] Check authentication requirements work

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ Functions accessible (may show auth errors - that's correct!)
- ‚úÖ Error messages indicate proper security
- ‚úÖ Anonymous authentication works for testing

### **Test 2: Create First Admin User** ‚è∞ 10 minutes

**Test Users to Create:**

- Coach: test-coach@example.com
- Scout: test-scout@example.com
- Player: test-player@example.com
- Fan: test-fan@example.com

### **Test 4: Application Integration** ‚è∞ 15 minutes

- [ ] Test teamCharts.js with authentication
- [ ] Verify role-based access on different pages
- [ ] Check data loading works with custom claims

**Pages to Test:**

- Admin Portal: http://localhost:3000/admin.html
- Team Charts: http://localhost:3000/team.html (may need team data)
- Player Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/player.html

### **Test 5: Security Validation** ‚è∞ 10 minutes

- [ ] Verify no API keys in browser console/network
- [ ] Test that non-admin users can't assign roles
- [ ] Check authentication persistence
- [ ] Validate audit logging is working
